oneLine in space is a mathematical based drawing simulation that meant to be shared with the creative coding community. The idea of drawing with numbers and code has been established since the creation of open source language Processing.

     Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.

oneLine in space app is an example to migrate "drawing with code" into the platform of iOS environment. It meant to attract the designers/artist who work with processing language to try iOS platform. It showcases the possibility of visual artists making apps.
  
same drawing models as in Processing.org

<a>http://guangless.com/web/testing_JS2.html </a> pressed the key for connected lines.

It is easy to visualize mathematics with Processing language, however it seems complicated to draw a simple curve with a set of equations and parameters. Like how in super developed human landscapes, finding a normal natural healthy pot of potatoes can be quite a workout! 



Code

    UIPanGestureRecognizer for two boxes.
    [Timer]in blue active the mathematical drawing in time
    set the time to be smaller, therefore to have fluid motion. -> scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: 0.1 
    standard equation for cardioid curve -> 
    float ex = r * ((2* cosf(i/M_2_PI + tempT )- cosf(2*(i/M_2_PI + tempT ))));

This is an example of how to visualize curve-like equations interactively with iOS environment. 
Why? More playing. Exploring the possibility of applications being “something else”, rather than always there ready to serve US? Maybe the relationship with me and my app is just as casual as a train ride.
