It is easy to visualize mathematics with Processing language, however it seems complicated to draw a simple curve with a set of equations and parameters with objective C. Like how in super developed human landscapes, finding a normal natural healthy pot of potatoes can be quite a workout! 

     Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.

oneLine app visualizes curve-like equations interactively in iOS environment. It is a mathematical based drawing simulation that shares with the creative coding community and beyond. The concept of drawing with numbers and code was established since the creation of open source language Processing. It migrates "drawing with code" to iOS platform. It invites designers/artists who work with processing language to try iOS development. It shows the possibility of visual artists making apps.

Code

    UIPanGestureRecognizer for two boxes.
    [Timer] is a thread to carry the math operation at the same time.
    set the time to be smaller, therefore to have fluid-like motion. -> scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: 0.1 
    standard equation for cardioid curve -> 
    float ex = r * ((2* cosf(i/M_2_PI + tempT )- cosf(2*(i/M_2_PI + tempT ))));
